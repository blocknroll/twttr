8.2.2
why do we need to explicitly put the users id in the session?
  in the sessions_helper?

listing 8.18
wtf?

listing 8.19
do we need to make a fixture in users.yml?
can't we just make one in def setup in the test file?

listing 8.22
helper methods aren't available in tests,
  so we can't use current_user
