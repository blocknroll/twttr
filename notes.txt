8.2.2
why do we need to explicitly put the users id in the session?
  in the sessions_helper?

listing 8.18
wtf?

listing 8.19
do we need to make a fixture in users.yml?
can't we just make one in def setup in the test file?

listing 8.22
helper methods aren't available in tests,
  so we can't use current_user

listing 8.31
remember token and digest = not very clear


listing 8.4.2
??? In the present design, an attacker with both cookies can log in as the user only until the user logs out.)


listing 8.50
  There’s one more subtlety, which is that for some reason inside tests
  the cookies method doesn’t work with symbols as keys,
  so that this is always nil...

      cookies[:remember_token]

  Luckily, cookies does work with string keys, so that this works...

      cookies['remember_token']

CHAPTER 9

integration tests == acceptance tests
  once the test passes, the feature is accepted as complete


AUTHORIZATION

before filters:
  To implement the forwarding behavior shown in Figure 9.6,
  we’ll use a before filter in the Users controller.

  Before filters use the before_action command to arrange
  for a particular method to be called before the given actions.

  To require users to be logged in, we define a logged_in_user method
  and invoke it using before_action :logged_in_user



FRIENDLY FORWARDING
  The store_location method in Listing 9.27 puts the requested URL
  in the session variable under the key :forwarding_url,
  but only for a GET request.
