8.2.2
why do we need to explicitly put the users id in the session?
  in the sessions_helper?

listing 8.18
wtf?

listing 8.19
do we need to make a fixture in users.yml?
can't we just make one in def setup in the test file?

listing 8.22
helper methods aren't available in tests,
  so we can't use current_user

listing 8.31
remember token and digest = not very clear


listing 8.4.2
??? In the present design, an attacker with both cookies can log in as the user only until the user logs out.)
